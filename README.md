# tec-controller
Demonstration of closed-loop control of surface temperature cooled by a thermoelectric (TEC) cooler. Monitor the temperature of the TEC using a data logging thermometer and control the current to the TEC using a bench-top power supply controlled by LXI commands. This creates a closed-loop control of the TEC.
